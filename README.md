Ramadan Hub was built to provide a **simple, elegant, and accessible** way for Muslims in Bangladesh to check their daily Sehri and Iftar times during Ramadan 1447 Hijri (2026).

Instead of searching through newspapers or unreliable websites, users can:
- Instantly see today's schedule for their division
- Set up automatic reminders
- Install the app on their phone for quick access
- Browse the entire month's calendar at a glance

The goal is to make Ramadan planning effortless — **one tap, all the info you need**.
